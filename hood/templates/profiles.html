                                Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) services in Kenya has the main objective of undertaking research to help livestock farmers with providing them with livestock with high genetic potential, develop disease control technologies, integrate crop-livestock etc..

                                The Government has provided resources for the construction of necessary laboratories and research centers. The organizationâ€™s head office is located in Loresho, in Nairobi County. In order to discharge its mandate, the organization has established research stations across the country. The branches are located at Lanet (Nakuru County), Garisa, Mariakani and Trans Mara.

                                KALRO have no research centers in Siaya county nor do they have any contact centers in the county. Farmers who need beef cattle production have to travel all the way to Kisumu County to a private ranch where they can be trained on beef cattle raring and buy heifers and bulls..
                                This has always been a hindrance for young famers who wants to venture into the field because without a nearby ranch or a research center, these farmers only opt for the locally available breeds that have very low bone to meat ratio and takes several years to mature before they are ready for the market. These breeds also fetch little money for these farmers.
 				These famers need locally available contact centers, or a ranch that KALRO has approved and can get the required information or buy cattle from.
                                Farmers need to know the type of breeds that can thrive in these areas, their feeding programs, pest and diseases affecting these breeds in these areas and also technologies to curb this menace.
				They also need to know the market demand for their livestock

                                Because of the above mentioned challenges faced by farmers plus due to personal interest and passion, they have led to the birth of Mlor Abera Ranch to solve these challenges.
                                This is also to inform our website visitors that more information will always be kept updated as they are received. We will also spread our wings and also add paultry farming in the near future.
